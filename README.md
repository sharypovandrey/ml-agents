## Documentation

* For more information, in addition to installation and usage instructions, see
  the [documentation for the latest release](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/latest_release/docs/Readme.md).
* If you are a researcher interested in a discussion of Unity as an AI platform, see a pre-print of our [reference paper on Unity and the ML-Agents Toolkit](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02627). Also, see below for instructions on citing this paper.
* If you have used an earlier version of the ML-Agents toolkit, we strongly
  recommend our [guide on migrating from earlier versions](docs/Migrating.md).
